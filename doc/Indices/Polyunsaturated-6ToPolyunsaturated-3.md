# Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid -6 to Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid -3 Ratio (Omega -6 to Omega -3 Ratio)

$$\frac{\sum PUFA(n - 6)}{\sum PUFA(n - 3)}$$

* **Abbreviation**: PUFA(n-6)/PUFA(n-3)
* **Description**: Indicates the balance between these two types of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids in the body.
    * *Inflammatory Balance*: Omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are precursors to molecules that regulate inflammation. While omega-6 fatty acids are generally pro-inflammatory, omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects. An imbalance with a high proportion of omega-6 to omega-3 can lead to chronic low-grade inflammation, which is associated with various chronic diseases.
    * *Risk of Chronic Diseases*: A high n-6/n-3 ratio is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other inflammatory conditions. Conversely, a lower, more balanced ratio is considered beneficial for preventing these health issues.
    * *Cellular Health*: Both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are crucial components of cell membranes and are necessary for regulating blood pressure and other bodily functions. The balance between them is vital for optimal cellular function.
