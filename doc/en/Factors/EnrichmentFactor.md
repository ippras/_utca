# Enrichment factor

$$\frac{X_{\{2: i\}}}{3 X_{\{1,2,3: i\}}}$$

* **Description**: The enrichment factor (EF) measures how much a specific fatty
  acid is enriched at the sn-2 position of a triacylglycerol (TAG) compared to
  its overall concentration. A higher SF reveals a greater competitive advantage for a
  particular fatty acid for that position.
* **Interpretation**:
  * `< 1.0` indicates a preference for the sn-1 and sn-3 positions;
  * `= 1.0` indicates no preference for the sn-2 position;
  * `> 1.0` indicates a preference for the sn-2 position.
