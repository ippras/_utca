# Enrichment factor

$$\frac{2}{3} EF - 1$$

$$\frac{X_{\{2:I\}}}{X_{\{1:I | 2:I | 3:I\}}}$$

* **Description**: The enrichment factor (EF) measures how much a specific fatty
  acid is enriched at the sn-2 position of a triacylglycerol (TAG) compared to
  its overall concentration. A higher SF reveals a greater competitive advantage
  for a particular fatty acid for that position.
* **Interpretation**:
  * `< 0.5` indicates a preference for sn-1 and sn-3 positions;
  * `= 0.5` indicates no preference for sn positions;
  * `> 0.5` indicates a preference for the sn-2 position.
