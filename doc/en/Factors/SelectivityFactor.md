# Selectivity factor

$$\frac{X_{\{2: i\}}}{X_{\{1,2,3: i\}}} \cdot \frac{\sum X_{\{1,2,3: U\}}}{\sum X_{\{2: U\}}}$$

* **Description**: Selectivity factor (SF) quantifies the relative preference
  for that specific fatty acid at the sn-2 position compared to other fatty
  acids that are also preferentially esterified there. A higher SF reveals a
  greater competitive advantage for a particular fatty acid for that position.
* **Purpose**: It provides a comparative measure of how strongly a specific
  fatty acid competes for the sn-2 position relative to other fatty acids that
  show a preference for it.
* **Interpretation**: A higher SF indicates that a specific fatty acid has a
  stronger affinity for the sn-2 position compared to other sn-2-preferring
  fatty acids.
