# Pooled Standard Deviation

$$ s_{pooled} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1) s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1) s_2^2 + \dots + (n_k - 1) s_k^2}{n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_k - k }} $$

The **Pooled Standard Deviation** is a weighted average of standard deviations
for two or more groups. The individual standard deviations are averaged, with
more weight given to larger sample sizes.
