# Cold filter plugging point

$CFPP = 3.1417 * LCSF - 16.477$ ([Ramos *et al.*, 2009])

One important parameter for low temperature applications of a fuel is the cold
filter plugging point (CFPP). The CFPP is the temperature at which a fuel jams a
filter due to the formation of agglomerates crystals.

## Biodiesel standards

The EN 14214-2005 standard does not mention a low-temperature parameter in its
specification lists. However, each country using EN 14214 can specify certain
temperature limits for different times of a year depending on climate
conditions.
