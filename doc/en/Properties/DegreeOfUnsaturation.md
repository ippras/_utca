# Degree of unsaturation

$DU = w_{monounsaturated} + 2 * w_{polyunsaturated(2)} + 3 * w_{polyunsaturated(3)} + 4 * w_{polyunsaturated(4)}$ ([Wang *et al.*, 2012])

Fuel properties such as cetane number (CN), iodine value (IV) and oxidation
stability (OS) are mainly determined by the degree of unsaturation (DU) of fatty
acid in raw oils. When the degree of unsaturation of raw oils fatty acid is
lower than 133.13, cetane number (GB/T 20828-2007) and iodine number (EN 14214)
meet the standards.
